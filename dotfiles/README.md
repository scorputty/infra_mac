## Customize/extend

You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the `system/.custom` file which will be sourced from `.bash_profile` automatically. This file is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`.

* The runcom `.bash_profile` sources all `~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
* The installer (`install.sh`) will run `~/.extra/install.sh`.
